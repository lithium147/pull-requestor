Using builders allows for immutable classes.
Migrates @Data classes to use @Builder/@SuperBuilder.
@Data is equivalent to @Getter @Setter @RequiredArgsConstructor @ToString @EqualsAndHashCode.
But @EqualsAndHashCode and @Setter are dropped which won't work if class is mutated or used in a Set.
@RequiredArgsConstructor is not required since @Builder provides a constructor.
Excluding:
- Config - requires nested builder classes, and not much to gain
- Entity - these classes might be mutated by the orm
@Jacksonized - lets jackson know about the builder for deserialization
